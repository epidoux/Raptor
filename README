1) What is Raptor?

	Raptor is a free software used to execute a scenario. A scenario contained several tasks with one or more goal (crawl something on web, do something (an "action") on the result then send it).
	
	For example: A scenario containing 3 Tasks. The first one has to get articles from a website, the second has to translate the content in english then finally the third one has to send the result by email.


2) Technical informations:

	This project is developed in JAVA and used a lot of API to satisfy all needs for tasks. 
	
	I will describe here the inheritance of classes for Task (There is 3 type of classes for the moment matching to the 3 possible actions you can do
for the moment:
		- CRAWL: get a content somewhere (html on website, rss feed,...) and transform it into text or List<articles>
		- ACTION : the action to perform on the result of the crawl task (translation,...)
		- SEND : Send the result somewhere (email, wordpress,...)
		
	Versions:
	
	    Version 1.0 : For the release 1.0, raptor is linked to a Mysql database only. 
	    	It can do those tasks :
	            - Collect active scenarios and execute them if it's the time to do it.
	
			    - Extract one or more parts of a website (Using Jsoup library: http://jsoup.org/)
		
			    - Send email with the result of the last task (Using Javamail : http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javamail/index.html)
		
			    - Translate the result given by the previous task
		
			    - Post articles on Wordpress ( Using Wordpress API : http://code.google.com/p/wordpress-java/)

4) How to install Raptor on your computer/server ?

	A) To install Raptor you have to install Java first and a DB server (mysql for example) on your computer. 
	B) Then create launch the script given is the folder /DBscript to create the database.
	C) Edit the conf file in META-INF/robot.properties as you wish.
	D) Prepare your scenario in your database (i will create a script soon to do this in command line/ please refer to the documentation of database in /DBscript/docDB.txt):
		- Create a user in the table "user"
		- Create your first scenario with the table "scenario" and use the id of your user as foreign key
		- Create all your tasks (including (or not) tags and/or conditions)
	E) Execute Raptor (use a cron task if possible)
	
That's all for the moment... (I will add more information about it with a full documentation and install process).
